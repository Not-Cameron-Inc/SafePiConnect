# SafePiConnect
This is the android application for the ***SafePi*** project. This application communicates with the SafPi device over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as well as with ***SafePiWeb***. It's main functionality is to register new users, and provision new ***SafePi*** devices, but it also implements a BLE Scanner for connecting and viewing other devices in the users proximity. 

TODO: 
- Structure UI with proper activities and interfacing.
- Implement login/registration screen.
- Implement controls menu. 
- Expand the scanner with more device information, and the ability to connect.
